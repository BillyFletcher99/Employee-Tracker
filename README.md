I did not finish the vast majority of this, i ran into issues with SQL. To be frank, i believe i understand how it's being implemented and how i can use it in layout, but dear lord is getting it installed, and working correctly very difficult. I still don't think i have working correct, as when i'm doing my node index.js in prompt it's just acting like nothing is happening. Hypothetically this would of a been a prompt that would come up, in which you could choose and navigate through the window. I have some other lines of code that (like viewemployee) that would of activitaed when chosen and let you go through the in menu of viewemployee. Also to be honest, that part was pretty hard for me. I watched a bunch of videos and looked at examples, but it still made little sense.
